# ERC20Permit: Hardhat & React Integration

Welcome to the **ERC20Permit: Hardhat & React Integration** repository! This project demonstrates the implementation and testing of the ERC20 Permit feature using a Hardhat-based smart contract and a React frontend for seamless user interaction.

## :computer: About the Project

This repository consists of two main parts:

1. **Protocol**: A Hardhat application implementing the ERC20Permit functionality, complete with a suite of tests to ensure contract reliability.
2. **Frontend**: A React application facilitating user interaction with the ERC20Permit contract, showcasing how users can engage with the contract features in a real-world scenario.

## :zap: Features

- ERC20 Permit smart contract implementation using Hardhat :rocket:
- Extensive test suite covering ERC20 Permit functionality :test_tube:
- React-based frontend for user interaction with the smart contract :art:
- Integration with popular wallet interfaces for a realistic user experience :purse:

## :star2: Inside the Repository

### Protocol Folder

- Hardhat setup for ERC20Permit contract development
- Test cases validating the ERC20 Permit feature

### Frontend Folder

- React application scaffolding
- Interface components for ERC20Permit contract interaction
- Wallet integration for transaction handling

## :rocket: Getting Started

### Protocol Setup

1. Enter the `protocol` directory and install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd protocol
   npm install
   ```

2. Execute the test suite to ensure everything is functioning correctly:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the React development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.
